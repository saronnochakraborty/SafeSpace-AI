🌿 SafeSpace AI  
   *Your Safe Space for Mental Wellness*

SafeSpace AI is an intelligent mental wellness companion that offers users a calm and judgment-free environment to express their thoughts.  
It listens, understands, and responds with empathy — helping you reflect on your emotions while providing encouragement, grounding advice, or gentle guidance when needed.

💡 Features

- 🧠 **Emotion Detection** – Analyzes text input using a fine-tuned emotion recognition model.  
- 💬 **Empathetic Responses** – Replies according to your emotional state:  
  - 🌞 *Positive:* Encouraging and celebratory messages.

  - 🌤️ *Neutral:* Calm reflections and light motivational prompts.

⚙️ How It Works

1. **Backend (Flask Server)**  
   - Runs the AI model (`joeddav/distilbert-base-uncased-go-emotions-student`) from Hugging Face.  
   - Detects emotional tones from user messages with high accuracy.  

2. **Frontend (HTML + JS Interface)**  
   - `page1.html` – landing page introducing the app.  
   - `page2.html` – chat interface that connects to the Flask API and displays responses.  

3. **Interaction Flow**  
   - Type a message expressing how you feel.  
   - The backend analyzes it and identifies one or more emotions.  
   - SafeSpace AI replies with empathy, offering encouragement or helpful resources.
